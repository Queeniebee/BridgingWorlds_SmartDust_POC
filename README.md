Proof of Concept code for Bridging Worlds Multiple Sensor assignment
====================================================================

The Smart Dust platform is publishing data. There are three monitors, just laptops in this case, that are three separate subscribers. In the POC, there the server is the provided Spacebrew cloud server. In the next prototyping phase, I will establish a WLAN broadcasting an IP so that the monitors/computers can connect without Internet.

Videos will be played on the monitors, each of which will be altered by an OpenGL shader whose intensity is determined by the FSR range values.


Processing Sketches
-------------------
The BridgingWorlds_POC_Threadbare is to be copied; the "value" variable is to hold of the sensor range values.
